## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a desaturated, bright tone of the primary hue, to keep the interface clean and focused.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), an analogous hue for interactive elements and key actions.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern and neutral look.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif font, paired with 'Inter' for body text, creating visual hierarchy and legibility.
- Consistent use of lucide-react vector icons across the application to provide visual cues and enhance user experience.
- Clean and responsive layout using Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach. The interface will feature clear sections for data presentation and straightforward navigation.
